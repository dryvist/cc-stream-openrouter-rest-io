# cc-stream-pack-template

Template repository for new Cribl Stream packs. Provides a TypeScript +
Vitest test harness, Biome lint/format, reusable GitHub Actions workflows, and a
Makefile that wraps the common day-to-day commands.

## What's in the box

- **Test harness** — Vitest tests that validate route + pipeline behavior against
  a live Cribl container (auto-discovered fixtures, no test code edits to add cases)
- **CI** — reusable GitHub Actions workflows for validate + test + release
- **Lint/format** — Biome with pre-commit hook (lefthook)
- **Release** — release-please-driven version bumps + `.crbl` artifact upload

## Installation

```sh
GH_TOKEN=<org-admin-token> \
  gh repo create dryvist/cc-edge-<source>-io \
    --template JacobPEvans-personal/cc-stream-pack-template \
    --public --clone

cd cc-edge-<source>-io
make install            # installs Node deps + git hooks
```

Org-repo creation needs a token with `Administration: Read & write` on the
dryvist org (standard user PATs typically can't). `make install` needs Node
20+ and pnpm 10+. Docker is only needed for `make test`. See
[`docs/development.md`](docs/development.md) for the dev shell.

## After scaffolding

Replace template placeholders before opening your first PR:

- `package.json` — `name`, `displayName`, `description`, `tags`, `author`
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` — flip `pack_type:` from `edge` to `stream` if
  this is a Cribl Stream pack (default is `edge`)
- `default/pack.yml` — optional: replace the empty `logo:` with a base64 PNG
  for the Cribl UI

Then replace the demo passthrough pipeline (`default/pipelines/passthrough/`)
and its fixture (`tests/fixtures/passthrough/`) with your pack's real
pipelines and fixtures.

## Usage

```sh
make docker-up          # start cribl/cribl test container
make test               # vitest run (auto-discovers fixtures)
make typecheck          # tsc --noEmit
make lint               # biome check
make format             # biome format --write
make build              # build .crbl artifact
make docker-down        # stop test container
```

Add a fixture under `tests/fixtures/<pipeline>/<case>.json` and `make test`
picks it up automatically — no code changes required.

End-to-end proof against a real routing engine (not `/preview`):

```sh
node --experimental-strip-types e2e/run.ts          # 1000 events in -> counted out
KEEP=1 node --experimental-strip-types e2e/run.ts   # keep Cribl up afterward:
                                                    # http://localhost:19000 (admin/admin)
```

## Releases

Don't tag versions manually. release-please opens a PR with the computed
version bump on every push to `main`; merge that PR to publish a release. See
[`docs/release-process.md`](docs/release-process.md).

## Contributing

Conventional commits required (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`). Branches
must start with `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, etc. (org ruleset). PRs against
`main` are squash-merged.

Changes here propagate to every downstream pack — tread carefully. See
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and [`docs/file-boundary.md`](docs/file-boundary.md).
